# Computational Methods for Physics
The purpose of this repository is to create a place for me and my colleagues to store all the scripts written during exercise lessons for future use in our careers.

The arguments of the class include:
- Monte Carlo Method
- Numerical derivation and integration
- Numerical solutions to ODEs and PDEs
- Physics Simulations from Classical Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics and Biological Models
